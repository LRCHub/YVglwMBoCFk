Ace high in golden
I was tall and on the rocks
And a little touch of attitude
Who's that Madame X
Comon' in at three o'clock
Why don't you send her over,
one, two
Next thing I remember
I was crawlin' round the room
She was dacin' on the table
Blood shot barking' at the moon
Colorado Bulldog
This night has gone to my head
Colorado bulldog
Throw a leash around my neck
Turn  around and run like hell
Swingin' from the rafters,
Losin' all control
Playin' a little game of cat
and mouse
I poped the question
I've been lonely much too long
Last call, the drinks are on
the house
Next thing I remember
Through the pandemonium
It was feelin' like a nightmare
That bites right into my skin
Colorado Bulldog
This night has gone to my head
Colorado Bulldog
Throw a leash around my neck
Turn  around and run like hell
My sweet Lolita, a preying
maneater
Left me in the number six motel
How was I to know
She'd strip me to the bone
And steal away my heart as well
Next thing I remember
Through the pandemonium
It was feelin' like a nightmare
That bites right into my skin
Colorado bulldog
This night has gone to my head
Colorado Bulldog
Throw a leash around my neck
Turn  around and run like hell
Colorado Bulldog
This night has gone to my head
Colorado Bulldog
Throw a leash around my neck
Bottoms up, down the hatch
It's time to start all over
again.
