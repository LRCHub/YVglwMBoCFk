I get high like Colorado
We had it all but what do I know
I try to push away the sorrow
But today it's too late,
I try tomorrow
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I think that
you were kind of mean
(kind of mean, kind of mean)
You just replaced me
in the scene
(in the scene, in the scene)
I thought that we were evergreen
(evergreen, evergreen)
Like a never-ending dream
Never been on the TV
Scratched me off of your CV
Out of your mind
Out of your mind
Never been so uneasy
Jealousy got me freaky
Out of my mind
So I get high like Colorado
We had it all but what do I know
I try to push away the sorrow
But today it's too late,
I try tomorrow
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I'm losing sleep all by myself
I'm wide awake
and I just wonder how
You put my heart back
on the shelf
(back on the shelf)
Well, Imma be a loner now
Never been on the TV
Scratched me off of your CV
Out of your mind
Out of your mind
Never been so uneasy
Jealousy got me freaky
Out of my mind
So I get high like Colorado
We had it all but what do I know
I try to push away the sorrow
But today it's too late,
I try tomorrow
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
Drowning in my sofa
with my blood shot red eyes
Riding rollercoaster
till I see the sunrise
I get high like Colorado
(I get high, I get high)
We had it all but what do I know
I try to push away the sorrow
But today it's too late,
I try tomorrow
(Yeah yeah, yeah yeah)
I get high like Colorado
(Colorado, Colorado, Colorado)
I get high like Colorado
(Colorado, Colorado, Colorado)
