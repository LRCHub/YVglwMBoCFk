All the places I could be
Too many to choose
I'm getting tired of East LA
Oh I think it's time to move
I'm spending all my money
I'm losing all my friends
And I'll be left with nothing
If this don't ever end
Lets just go
Find a road
And follow all the signs
That lead to Colorado
Lets just go
Find a home
And maybe settle down
For a couple months or so
Colorado
Saying things I've never said
Doing things I never did
Everybody here is so in love
Until the next one walks in
I'm spending all my money
I'm losing all my friends
And I'll be left with nothing
If this don't ever end
Lets just go
Find a road
And follow all the signs
That lead to Colorado
Lets just go
Find a home
And maybe settle down
For a couple months or so
Colorado
Take me to the place I know
Take me to the hills where my mother was grown
Lets just go
Find a road
And follow all the signs
That lead to Colorado
Lets just go
Find a home
And maybe settle down
For a couple months or so
Colorado
